# Modul 4: Jobbe med Json i rust (serde)


# Challenge
Now it's time to put what you've learned into practice! In this module's challenge, you'll:

1. Add the serde and serde_json dependencies to your project's Cargo.toml file
2. Apply the Serialize and Deserialize derive macros to your User and UserDetails types
3. Modify your main function to:
   + Create a user and serialize it to JSON
   + Print the JSON to the console
   + Parse a JSON string back into a User struct
4. Experiment with customizing the JSON output by adding at least one serde attribute (like rename_all)
5. Ensure you can successfully compile and run your application to confirm the JSON serialization works

If you're struggling, you can find a solution on GitHub. Try it on your own first, if you're finding it difficult that's good. It means you're learning.

Good luck, and remember that working with JSON in Rust gives you the benefits of strong type checking while maintaining high performance!
