Hey intrepid .NET developer, you're about to go on a journey into the wonderful world of the Rust programming language.

Now I know what you're thinking. Rust is a systems programming language. Why does that matter to me as a .NET developer who is building business applications?

And here's the thing, Rust is a fantastic language for building all types of business applications. From software running on embedded devices through to line of business applications & API's.

That's the journey you're going to go on throughout this workshop. You're going to sit in the shoes of a Rust developer building a brand new user authentication service for your company.

The service is going to allow users to:

- Register a new account
- Login
- Retrieve their account information
- Update their account details

And you're going to build the whole thing in Rust. Yep, you ðŸ«µ

But don't worry, you'll do the whole thing with nice, safe, re-assuring .NET examples alongside. So you can directly relate concepts in .NET to a similar concept in Rust.

And where there isn't a direct match, there will be full explanations of the Rust language to help you out.
