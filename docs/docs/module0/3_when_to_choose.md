# When to choose Rust

Given these pros and cons, when should you as a .NET developer consider using Rust?

- **Performance-critical systems**: When every millisecond counts
- **Resource-constrained environments**: Edge computing, IoT devices, or high-density services
- **Systems programming**: OS components, embedded systems, or drivers
- **Security-sensitive applications**: Where memory safety issues could lead to exploits
- **High-scale concurrent systems**: Handling thousands of simultaneous connections efficiently

Rust doesn't need to replace all your C# code. Many organizations are adopting Rust strategically for specific components where its strengths provide the most benefit, while continuing to use .NET for other parts of their systems.

Throughout this workshop, you'll learn how to assess where Rust makes sense for you and your projects, and how to leverage your existing .NET knowledge to become productive in Rust.
