# Why?

Start With Why by Simon Sinek. A book that flipped how I view many things in technology. As a software engineer, it's very easy to get caught up in what and how. What do I need to build? And how exactly do I need to build it? Normally spending more time than neccessary on that second one.

That misses a fundamental question though, **why?** To understand why I need to do something, makes the what and the how so much easier to understand.

So what's where I want to start today, why Rust?

## Why Rust?

1. Performance
2. Sustainability
3. Resource consumptions
4. 

## Why Not Rust?

1. Learning curve
2. Lack of developers
