# Challenge

Let's expand the functionality of the `User` enum a little bit:

1. Add an *optional* age property to the UserDetails struct
2. Add a new `update_age` function to update a users age with a new value
3. Add a `whats_my_age()` function to return the users age
4. Update the console application to test out your new functions

The starter code for this challenge is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/jeastham1993/rust-for-dotnet-devs-workshop/tree/main/src/examples/module3/rust_app).

If you're struggling, you can find [a solution on GitHub](https://github.com/jeastham1993/rust-for-dotnet-devs-workshop/tree/main/src/solutions/module3/rust_app). But try it on your own first, if you're finding it difficult that's good. It means you're learning.
