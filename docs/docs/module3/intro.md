# Data Types

Let's get into starting to model our business domain. No low level systems programming here, let's build something real together.

If you recall, functionality wise you need to build a service that allows users to:

- Register a new account
- Login
- Retrieve their account information
- Update their account details

Which means you need to model a `User`. `Users` are also going to need properties, you know things like `first_name`, `last_name`. So let's look at the different data types available in Rust that you'll use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By convention, variables in Rust use `_` instead of `camelCase` or `snakeCase`

```rust showLineNumbers
// A string slice is a view into a string, or a reference to a string.
// It's fixed size that's known at compile time,
// It's does not require heap allocation
// Comparable with Span<String> in .NET
// Idiomatic Rust use snake case instead of camelCase
let str_example: &str = "Hello";
println!("{}", str_example);

// A string is a heap-allocated string. It's growable, and can be modified
let string_example: String = "Hello".to_string();
println!("{}", string_example);

let integer_example: i32 = 10;
println!("{}", str_example);

let float_example: f32 = 10.0;
println!("{}", float_example);

// Arrays are fixed size in Rust, and the size is declared at initialization
let array_example: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
println!("{}", array_example.len());

// Vecs are growable, heap-allocated arrays. They are the most commonly used collection in Rust.
// Vecs are similar to Lists in C#
// to add values to a Vec, you use the push method and the vec itself must be mutable
let vec_example: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];
println!("{}", vec_example.len());

let bool_example: bool = true;
println!("{}", bool_example);
```
