# Memory Management

Ok, you got me. There are some pretty fundamental differences between Rust and .NET that you'll encounter as you make this transition. Understanding these differences is key to your success with Rust.

## Memory Management

In .NET, you're used to the garbage collector handling memory for you. When you create objects, the runtime allocates memory, and when those objects are no longer referenced, the garbage collector eventually reclaims that memory.

In Rust, you'll encounter a completely different approach:
- **No Garbage Collection**: Rust doesn't use a garbage collector, which means no unpredictable pauses or runtime overhead.
- **Deterministic Cleanup**: Memory is freed at predictable points in your codeâ€”specifically, when variables go out of scope.
- **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**: Resources like file handles, network connections, and memory are tied to object lifetimes and automatically cleaned up when they're no longer needed.

This deterministic memory management gives you greater control and predictability. Your Rust programs will typically use less memory than equivalent .NET applications and have more consistent performance characteristics since there are no garbage collection pauses.
