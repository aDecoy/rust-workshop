# Challenge

There is no explicit coding challenge in this example, however, I would recommend exploring the [memory demo](https://github.com/jeastham1993/rust-for-dotnet-devs-workshop/tree/main/src/solutions/module2/1-memory-safety) and [memory efficiency](https://github.com/jeastham1993/rust-for-dotnet-devs-workshop/tree/main/src/solutions/module2/2-sustainability) demos alongside their .NET counterparts.

Open up Activity Monitor on Mac, or Task Manager on Windows, and then run both the .NET and Rust examples and see how it affects your local resource consumption.
