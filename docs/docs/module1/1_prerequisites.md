# Prerequisites

This workshop gives you the opportunity to get hands on and build out a real Rust service. To do that though, you're going to need some things installed on your machine:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
    - The language itself is kind of important. If you're on a Windows machine I'd highly recommend using WSL2 instead of Windows itself
- Docker Client
    - The ability to run Docker images, and the ability to run `docker compose`
- You may also want to clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jeastham1993/rust-for-dotnet-devs-workshop) with the examples and solutions
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jeastham1993/rust-for-dotnet-devs-workshop
    ```

And that's it, that's the bare minimum you'll need to get through all the content in this workshop.

## Dev Containers

Docs for [dev container](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers) are coming soon.
