# Progam Structure

For some of you older .NET developers, you might remember the days when a .NET application had a `Program.cs` file and a `static void Main()` method that looked a little bit something like this:

```csharp showLineNumbers
static void Main(object[] args){
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");    
}
```

And then Microsoft went and made things all simpler, which means a .NET application still has a `Program.cs` file, now it looks a little bit something like this:

```csharp
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

Now if you squint and look at this piece of code, go on. Really squint. I'm sure you can see the similarities with Rust:

```rust showLineNumbers showLineNumbers
fn main() {
    // highlight-next-line
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

:::important

The entrypoint to all Rust programs is `main()`. It takes no arguments, and returns no value.

:::

Yep, you've got a function (in Rust world, you call them functions not methods) called main. And then you're printing a line (`println!`) to the console. Code blocks, or scopes, are wrapped in curly braces: `{}`.

Pretty similar to .NET right?

## Run Your Application

What's that, you want to run your application now? Cool, cool. In .NET land, that would look a little bit something like this wouldn't it:

```sh
dotnet run
```

I bet you can't guess the Rust CLI command:

```sh
cargo run
```
