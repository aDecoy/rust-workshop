# Traits, Generics, and Lifetimes in Rust

In this module, you'll learn about three fundamental Rust concepts that enable flexible, reusable, and safe code: traits, generics, and lifetimes. For you as a .NET developer, these concepts have some similarities to interfaces, generics, and reference management in C#, but with Rust's unique approach to memory safety and zero-cost abstractions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand what traits are and how they compare to interfaces in .NET
- Learn how to implement and use traits for abstraction
- Master generic types and trait bounds
- Gain a basic understanding of Rust's lifetime system
- Apply these concepts to build more flexible and maintainable applications
