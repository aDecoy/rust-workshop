# Challenge

1. Let's implement a service to process messages from Kafka
2. You'll need the `rdkafka` crate, with the `tokio` and `ssl` features
3. Update your integration tests to publish a message to Kafka to test the background service in Rust

The starter code for this challenge is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/jeastham1993/rust-for-dotnet-devs-workshop/tree/main/src/examples/module11/rust_app).

If you're struggling, you can find [a solution on GitHub](https://github.com/jeastham1993/rust-for-dotnet-devs-workshop/tree/main/src/solutions/module11/rust_app). Try it on your own first, if you're finding it difficult that's good. It means you're learning.
