# Challenge

Now it's time to apply what you've learned about modular architecture! In this module's challenge, you'll:

1. Take the monolithic web API from the previous module and split it into a modular architecture
2. Create separate files for:
   - `core.rs`: Containing your domain models and business logic
   - `data_access.rs`: Containing your data storage mechanism
   - `main.rs`: For your API endpoints and application setup
3. Apply appropriate visibility modifiers to enforce architectural boundaries
4. Ensure all modules are properly connected and the API still works as expected

Specifically, you need to:
- Move all domain types (User, UserDetails) and their implementations to the core module
- Move data storage (AppState) to the data access module
- Use proper visibility modifiers (pub, pub(crate)) to restrict access where appropriate
- Create clear module boundaries between business logic and infrastructure concerns
- Update imports in the main file to reference these new modules

The starter code for this challenge is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/jeastham1993/rust-for-dotnet-devs-workshop/tree/main/src/examples/module6/rust_app).

If you're struggling, you can find [a solution on GitHub](https://github.com/jeastham1993/rust-for-dotnet-devs-workshop/tree/main/src/solutions/module6/rust_app). But try it on your own first, if you're finding it difficult that's good. It means you're learning.

Good luck, and remember that a well-structured application will be much easier to maintain and extend as it grows!
