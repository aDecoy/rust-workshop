# Testing in Rust

In this module, you'll learn how to implement effective testing practices in Rust. For you as a .NET developer, you'll find that while many testing concepts are similar to what you're used to, Rust's unique features enable some powerful testing approaches.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand Rust's built-in testing framework
- Write unit tests and integration tests in Rust
- Use test fixtures and mocks in Rust
- Implement property-based testing with proptest
- Practice test-driven development in Rust
