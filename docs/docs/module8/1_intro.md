# Working with Databases in Rust

In this module, you'll learn how to work with relational databases in Rust using the SQLx library with PostgreSQL. For you as a .NET developer, this is comparable to using Entity Framework or Dapper, but with Rust's type safety and performance advantages. You'll also learn about error handling patterns in Rust.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand what SQLx is and how it provides type-safe database access
- Configure and connect to a PostgreSQL database
- Write and execute type-safe SQL queries in Rust
- Implement proper error handling for database operations
- Create database migrations using the SQLx CLI
